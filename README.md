# Java Test Client Template

This repository is a template project for building a Java test client that can be run independently from its test target.  This pattern of testing is typically referred to asend-to-end (E2E) integration testing.  This test client uses the JUnit 5 (Jupiter) test engine to run Cucumber-defined tests.
